    <p className="paragraph">
      I was introduced to coding during my youth and have evolved with its
      continuum, constantly learning new methods, practicies and languages;
      always searching for and discovering ways to do and make that line of code
      perform &#34;better&#34; in every way.
    </p>
    <p className="paragraph">Coding is my passion!</p>
    <p className="paragraph">
      I love the world of programming and the possibility to constantly learn
      new things, being able to work with a team and make new friends.

      I am a proven team player and enjoy working with others, learning from
      them, listening to their ideas, while sharing my own knowledge. I am an
      intensely focused individual who spares no effort to detail when working
      on a project.

      I am looking to become part of a motivated, productive, programming team;
      a&nbsp;group where I can pour what is my passion into.
